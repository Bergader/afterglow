= Oscillators
James Elliott <james@deepsymmetry.org>

Oscillators in Afterglow are a flexible way of turning the timing
information tracked by <<metronomes#metronomes,metronomes>> into
waveforms that can be used to make lights do interesting things. They
can be related to the beats, bars, or phrases of the metronome, or
multiples or fractions thereof, and can create
<<sawtooth-oscillators,sawtooth>>, <<triangle-oscillators,triangle>>,
<<square-oscillators,square>>, or <<sine-oscillators,sine>> waves, or
any <<custom-oscillators,custom shape>> you can dream up and code a
shape function for.

Metronomes keep track of musical time relative to some starting point,
in terms of beats, bars (by default four beats to a bar), and phrases
(usually eight bars to a phrase). In addition to keeping track of the
current beat, bar, and phrase, metronomes can also tell you the _phase_
of that beat, bar, or phrase, which is a measurement of progress through
the beat, bar, or phrase. The phase starts out at 0.0 at the very
beginning of the interval, and grows towards, but never quite reaches,
1.0, because at that point you will be on to phase 0.0 of the following
interval.

So, in a sense, by itself a metronome can give you a
<<sawtooth-oscillators,sawtooth>> wave related to its intervals, just
by looking at the interval phase. The sawtooth oscillators build on that
by letting you change the direction of oscillation, so it starts at 1.0
and slides downward, the speed of oscillation, so it ramps over
multiples or fractions of an interval, and also let you shift the phase
of the wave so it does not coincide with the interval itself.

So that all of the lighting effects created for a given frame of control
output are synchronized and share the same notion of the current state
of the metronome, Afterglow takes a _snapshot_ of the metronome at the
start of the frame, and the oscillators work from that.

== Sawtooth Oscillators

[source,clojure]
----
(afterglow.effects.oscillators/sawtooth)
----

Returns an oscillator which generates a
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sawtooth_wave[sawtooth wave] relative to
the phase of the current beat. At the start of the beat, the value will
be 0.0, and at the end of the beat, the value will have grown linearly
to 1.0.

You can change the nature of the wave by using optional keyword
parameters, and the values you use with them can be be
<<parameters#dynamic-parameters,dynamic parameters>>:

[cols="2,1,4",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Parameter |Default |Purpose
|`:down?` |`false` |When `true` the wave starts at 1.0 and falls
linearly to 0.0.

|`:interval` |`:beat` |Change whether the oscillator cycles over each
beat, bar, or phrase, by passing in the keyword `:beat`, `:bar`, or
`:phrase`. There are graphs showing the other intervals below.

|`:interval-ratio` |`1` |Runs the oscillator at the specified
 <<ratios,multiple or fraction>> of the interval (beat, bar, or
 phrase).

|`:phase` |0.0 |<<phase-shifting,Offsets>> the oscillator from the
interval boundary by the specified amount (where 1.0 is an entire
interval, and so would have no visible effect).
|=======================================================================

As noted in the table, the direction of the wave can be reversed:

[[ratios]]
=== Ratios

All of the oscillators can be modified by supplying the
`:interval-ratio` keyword argument. This argument specifies a fraction
that adjusts the speed of the oscillator with respect to the interval
it is oscillating over. For example a beat-oriented oscillator
normally goes through its entire wave shape once per beat. If you
supply an `:interval-ratio` of `2`, it will run half as fast, taking
two beats to go through its waveform.

image::sawtooth-beat-ratio-2.png[Sawtooth Beat Oscillator with Beat Ratio 2,500,378]

An `:interval-ratio` of `1/3` speeds it up so that it only takes
one-third of a beat to go through its oscillation, and will finish
three complete cycles each beat.

image::sawtooth-beat-ratio-1-3.png[Sawtooth Oscillator with Interval Ratio 1/3,500,378]

These can be combined, of course, so an `:interval-ratio` of `2/3`
would complete three cycles every two beats.

image::sawtooth-beat-ratio-2-3.png[Sawtooth Oscillator with Interval Ratio 2/3,500,378]

[[phase-shifting]]
=== Phase Shifting

All of the oscillators can be modified by supplying a `:phase` keyword
argument, which offsets them from the actual phase of the interval that
they are tracking. For example, if you supply a `:phase` value of `0.5`,
the oscillator will be pushed exactly halfway out-of-phase with the
metronome interval, so that it will act as if a beat is starting halfway
through the actual beat. A positive value shifts the oscillator ahead of
the underlying interval, and a negative value delays it. Only values
between -1.0 and 1.0 make sense, since shifting multiple intervals has
no functional difference from staying within the current interval. In
other words, passing in exactly 1.0 (or 2.0, etc.) is the same as
passing in 0.0, and will have no effect on the oscillator.

image::sawtooth-beat-phase.png[Sawtooth Oscillator with Phase 0.25,500,378]

As noted in the table above, to have the oscillator work with
intervals other than beats, you use the optional keyword argument
`:interval`. For example to have the sawtooth spread over each bar:

----
(afterglow.effects.oscillators/sawtooth :interval :bar)

And to have it oscillate over each phrase:

[[triangle-oscillators]]

[source,clojure]
----
(afterglow.effects.oscillators/triangle)
----

Returns an oscillator which generates a
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle_wave[triangle wave] relative to
the phase of the current beat. At the start of the beat, the value will
be 0.0, at the midpoint, the value will have grown linearly to 1.0, and
at the end of the beat it will have returned to 0.0.

[[sine-oscillators]]
== Sine Oscillators

Just like in musical synthesis, sine waves are the smoothest-feeling
waves of all, and are good for creating gentle, subtle effects which
ease in and out.

[source,clojure]
----
(afterglow.effects.oscillators/sine)
----

Returns an oscillator which generates a
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine_wave[sine wave] relative to the phase
of the current beat. At the start of the beat, the value will be 0.0 and
beginning to rise slowly, picking up speed as it goes, and slowing down
again as it approaches the midpoint. At the midpoint, the value will
reach 1.0 and begin falling slowly, again picking up speed, and at the
end of the beat it will have returned to 0.0.

[[square-oscillators]]
== Square Oscillators

Square waves are good for abrupt transitions, like strobes, or switching
between different effects.

[source,clojure]
----
(afterglow.effects.oscillators/square)
----

Returns an oscillator which generates a
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_wave[square wave] relative to the
phase of the current beat. At the start of the beat, the value will be
1.0. At the midpoint, it will instantly drop to 0.0, where it will stay
until the end of the beat.

You can change the nature of the wave by using optional keyword
parameters, and the values you use with them can be be
<<parameters#dynamic-parameters,dynamic parameters>>:

[cols="2,1,4",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Parameter |Default |Purpose
|`:width` |`0.5` |Determines the phase at which the value changes from
1.0 to 0.0, and therefore the width of the 1.0 pulse

|`:interval` |`:beat` |Change whether the oscillator cycles over each
beat, bar, or phrase, by passing in the keyword `:beat`, `:bar`, or
`:phrase`. There are graphs showing the other intervals below.

|`:interval-ratio` |`1` |Runs the oscillator at the specified
 <<ratios,multiple or fraction>> of the interval (beat, bar, or
 phrase).

|`:phase` |0.0 |<<phase-shifting,Offsets>> the oscillator from the
beat by the specified amount
|=======================================================================

NOTE: The effects of the `:interval-ratio` and `:phase` parameters are
discussed in more depth, and illustrated with graphs, in the
documentation for the Sawtooth oscillator. You can jump to those
sections using the links in the _Purpose_ section of the table.

[[pulse-widths]]
=== Pulse Widths

As shown in the above graph, the square oscillator normally spends
half its time in the &ldquo;on&rdquo; state (at the value one), and
half its time &ldquo;off&rdquo; (at zero). You can adjust that by
passing a value between `0.0` and `1.0` with the optional keyword
argument `:width`. This tells the oscillator what fraction of the time
to be on. For example, with the value `0.8`, it is on 4/5 of the time:

[source,clojure]
----
(afterglow.effects.oscillators/square :width 0.8)
----

image::square-beat-width-8.png[Square Oscillator with Width 0.8,500,378]

Alternately, using a `:width` of `0.1` causes the oscillator to be on
for only one tenth of each beat:

[source,clojure]
----
(afterglow.effects.oscillators/square :width 0.1)
----

image::square-beat-width-1.png[Square Oscillator with Width 0.1,500,378]

You can shift where within the beat the transitions take place using
the `:phase` argument, as with all oscillators, in the manner
described <<phase-shifting,above>>.

NOTE: The `:width` value must be greater than `0` and less than `1`,
or the oscillator does not oscillate at all. A value of `0` leaves it
permanently off, and a value of `1` leaves it permanently on. Values
outside that range are not accepted.

As noted in the table above, to have the oscillator work with
intervals other than beats, you use the optional keyword argument
`:interval`. For example to have the wave spread over each bar:

[source,clojure]
----
(afterglow.effects.oscillators/square :interval :bar)
----

image::square-bar.png[Square Bar Oscillator,500,378]

And to have it oscillate over each phrase:

[source,clojure]
----
(afterglow.effects.oscillators/square :interval :phrase)
----
image::square-phrase.png[Square Phrase Oscillator,500,378]

[[custom-oscillators]]
== Custom Oscillators

You can build your own oscillator with any shape waveform that you
like by defining a _shape function_ for it, and let Afterglow do all
the hard work of hosting it within the oscillator framework by passing
that shape function to
{api-doc}afterglow.effects.oscillators.html#var-build-oscillator[`afterglow.effects.oscillators/build-oscillator`].
All of the oscillators you have seen so far use this approach, and you
can see how simple they actually are by looking at the source of one,
for example
{api-doc}afterglow.effects.oscillators.html#var-triangle[`triangle`],
which defines a the triangle wave oscillator. (Click on the `view
source` button at the bottom of the linked documentation.)

As you will see, most of the function consists of its documentation,
and its argument declaration, and those simply get passed on to
`build-oscillator`, which supports the `:interval`, `:interval-ratio`,
and `:phase` arguments you've seen in all the oscillator functions.
The core of `triangle` is setting up its shape function to create the
triangle wave which makes it a triangle oscillator.

[[shape-functions]]
=== Shape Functions

The shape function is the first argument to `build-oscillator`, and it
is simply a function which is given the current phase of the
oscillator, ranging from 0.0 to 1.0, and must return the value of the
oscillator's wave form when it is at that phase of oscillation. In the
case of a triangle wave, it needs to ramp up from 0 to 1 during the
first half of the oscillation (as the phase grows from 0 to 0.5), then
back down to 0 during the second half. Here is how `triangle`
implements that:

[source,clojure]
----
(fn [phase]
  (if (< phase 0.5)
    (* phase 2.0)
    (- 2.0 (* phase 2.0))))
----

The arguments to `triangle` are then passed along to
`build-oscillator` after the phase function, and the result is the
triangle oscillator behavior you can use in your shows.

Hopefully examining this example, as well as the source of the other
oscillators, can inspire you to create your own interesting oscillator
shapes.
