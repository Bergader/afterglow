Dynamic parameters provide a way to turn a simple cue into something
which changes over time and space, or reacts to operator input. Most
cues which take simple values can also take dynamic parameters which
evaluate to those values.

== Frame Dynamic Parameters

When creating a dynamic parameter, you can control _how_ dynamic it is.
The most dynamic, __frame dynamic__, are evaluated anew for every single
frame of control values that are sent out to the lights. If, on the
other hand, you want the value to be calculated when the effect is
started, and then stay constant, you can create the parameter with a
`false` value for `frame-dynamic?`

== Variable Parameters

Parameters can get their values from a __show variable__. Any number of
values can be stored in the show, by assigning them a keyword with the
function:

[source,clojure]
----
(afterglow.show/set-variable! :key value)
----

TIP: In addition to manually setting values in show variables, you can
use <<mapping_sync#mapping-a-control-to-a-variable,MIDI mappings>> to
have them set by turning a knob or sliding a fader on a MIDI control
surface.

You can then refer to that stored value whenever you are creating a
dynamic parameter by simply using the keyword (in this example, `:key`),
and the current value stored in the show variable will be used. This is
a convenience mechanism, you can also explicitly build a reference to a
show variable like this:

[source,clojure]
----
(afterglow.effects.params/build-variable-param :key)
----

The reason you might want to use the explicit creation function is that
you can control details about the binding by passing in optional keyword
parameters:

[cols=",,",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Parameter |Default |Purpose
|`:type` |`Number` |The type of value that is expected in the variable

|`:default` |`0` |The value to assign the parameter if the variable is
missing or has the wrong type

|`:assign-fn` |none |If supplied, is called with the value of the show
variable, and its return value is used as the value of the parameter

|`:frame-dynamic` |`true` |Whether the variable value should be looked
at at every frame, or just once
|=======================================================================

As an example of using these parameters, consider:

[source,clojure]
----
(afterglow.effects.params/build-variable-param :key
  :type Number :default 0 :adjust-fn #(* % 2))
----

This would cause the dynamic parameter to have a numeric value which is
twice the value found in the show variable.

When you use the keyword shorthand to bind to a show variable in
building another dynamic parameter, the type and default are assumed
from the context in which you are using the variable.

== Oscillated Parameters

Oscillated parameters vary over time, at a speed controlled by a
<<metronomes#metronomes,Metronome>> (usually the main show metronome,
synced to DJ equipment) and so can make the lights appear to be
reacting intelligently to the music being played. The timing
information produced by the metronome is fed into an
<<oscillators#oscillators,Oscillator>>, which determines the shape of
the wave that controls its value, and the frequency at which it
oscillates, related to beats, bars, or phrases of the underlying
metronome. The resulting value can then be scaled to meet the needs of
whatever is being generated (a dimmer level, color component, or light
rotation). Oscillated parameters are created by calling:

[source,clojure]
----
(afterglow.effects.params/build-oscillated-param oscillator)
----

The `oscillator` parameter is an
<<oscillators#oscillators,Oscillator>> created by one of the functions
in
http://deepsymmetry.org/afterglow/doc/afterglow.effects.oscillators.html[afterglow.effects.oscillators]
which, as described above, determines how to react to the time
information provided by the metronome. Additionally, you can supply
one of the following optional keyword parameters:

[cols=",,",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Parameter |Default |Purpose
|`:min` |`0` |The smallest value that the oscillated parameter will be
assigned

|`:max` |`255` |The largest value that the oscillated parameter will be
assigned

|`:metronome` |none |If supplied, is used instead of the main show
metronome

|`:frame-dynamic` |`true` |Whether the parameter should be calculated at
every frame, or just once
|=======================================================================

The keyword parameters `:min`, `:max`, and `:metronome` can themselves
be bound to show variables by passing in the keyword with which the show
variable was created. The frame-dynamic setting of such variable
bindings will be controlled by the frame-dynamic setting of the
oscillated parameter being created.

== Color Parameters

Color parameters are an extremely flexible way of dynamically assigning
color. The basic way to create one is to call:

[source,clojure]
----
(afterglow.effects.params/build-color-param)
----

By itself this call would simply return a non-dynamic black color.
However, you will use one or more of the following optional keyword
parameters to get the dynamic color you want:

[cols=",,",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Parameter |Default |Purpose
|`:color` |black |The base, starting color of this dynamic color

|`:r` |`0` |Red brightness, from 0 to 255

|`:g` |`0` |Green brightness, from 0 to 255

|`:b` |`0` |Blue brightness, from 0 to 255

|`:h` |`0.0` |Hue value, from 0.0 to 360.0

|`:s` |`0.0` |Saturaion value, from 0.0 to 100.0

|`:l` |`0.0` |Lightness value, from 0.0 to 100.0

|`:adjust-hue` |`0.0` |Hue shift value, from -360.0 to 360.0

|`:adjust-saturation` |`0.0` |Saturation shift value, from -100.0 to
100.0

|`:adjust-lightness` |`0.0` |Lightness shift value, from -100.0 to 100.0

|`:frame-dynamic` |`true` |Whether the parameter should be calculated at
every frame, or just once
|=======================================================================

All of these parameters, except for `frame-dynamic`, can themselves be
dynamic parameters, such as show <<variable-parameters,variables>>
(with the convenience shorthand of just passing in the keyword by which
the show variable was stored) or <<oscillated-parameters,oscillated
parameters>>.

Refer to <<color#working-with-color,Working with Color>> for a
refresher on the meaning of the basic color components. It would not
make sense to pass all of these parameters, because some will override
others, but here is how they are evaluated:

. The base color is established by the `:color` parameter.

. If any of `:r`, `:g`, or `:b` have been supplied, the color is
replaced by creating an RGB color with the values (or defaults)
supplied.

. If any of `:h`, `:s`, or `:l` have been supplied, the color is
replaced by creating an HSL color with the values (or defaults)
supplied.

. If `:adjust-hue` was supplied, the hue of the color obtained so far
is shifted by adding that amount to it (and wrapping around the color
circle if needed).

. If `adjust-saturation` was supplied, the saturation of the color is
adjusted by adding that amount to it, maxing out at 100.0, and bottoming
out at 0.0. Lower saturations yield less colorful (more gray) colors.

. If `adjust-lightness` was supplied, the lightness of the color is
adjusted by adding that amount to it, maxing out at 100.0, and bottoming
out at 0.0. A lightness of 50.0 allows for a fully saturated color,
lightnesses above that start getting whitened, and a lightness of 100.0
is pure white; lightnesses below 50.0 start getting darkened, and a
lightness of 0.0 is pure black.

Finally, the result of all this is the color that is returned by the
dynamic parameter. Afterglow tries to be as efficient about this as
possible, and do as much calculation as it can when the parameter is
created. If there are no frame dynamic parameters, it will return a
fixed color. But you can easily use frame-dynamic oscillated
parameters and get lovely shifting rainbow cues, as shown in the
<<effects#oscillator-effects,effect examples>>.

== Movement

There are three different kinds of parameters which tell fixtures how
to move. They differ in the way that you express direction or aim.

=== Direction Parameters

Direction parameters are one way to tell a group of fixtures to point
in a particular _direction_, or move in unison or in a coordinated
pattern. They are used with <<effects#direction-effects,Direction
Effects>>. (<<parameters#pan-tilt-parameters,Pan Tilt Parameters>> are
the other way to work with this kind of effect.) The basic way to
create one is to call:

[source,clojure]
----
(afterglow.effects.params/build-direction-param)
----

By itself this call would simply return a non-dynamic direction telling
fixtures to point directly at the audience. However, you will use one or
more of the following optional keyword parameters to get the dynamic
direction you want:

[cols=",,",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Parameter |Default |Purpose
|`:x` |`0` |The amount the light should point towards audience’s right

|`:y` |`0` |The amount the light should point up

|`:z` |`1` |The amount the light should point towards the audience

|`:frame-dynamic` |`true` |Whether the parameter should be calculated at
every frame, or just once
|=======================================================================

Collectively, `x`, `y`, and `z` specify a three-dimensional vector in
the light show’s <<show_space#show-space,frame of reference>> telling
the lights which direction they should point. The absolute magnitudes
of the values are not important, it is their relative sizes that
matter. The default of `[0, 0, 1]` means the lights point neither left
nor right, neither up nor down, and straight towards the audience.
`[1, 0, 0]` would be straight right, `[-1, 0, 0]` straight left, `[0,
1, 0]` straight up, and `[0, 1, -1]` up and away from the audience at
a 45° angle. When this vector is supplied to a
<<effects#direction-effects,Direction Effect>>, it causes the attached
lights to make the specified movement, if they are capable.

All of these parameters, except for `frame-dynamic`, can themselves be
dynamic parameters, such as show <<variable-parameters,variables>>
(with the convenience shorthand of just passing in the keyword by which
the show variable was stored) or <<oscillated-parameters,oscillated
parameters>>.

=== Aim Parameters

Aim parameters are a way to tell a group of fixtures to aim at a
particular _point_ in space, or track something in unison or in a
coordinated pattern. They are used with <<effects#aim-effects,Aim
Effects>>. The basic way to create one is to call:

[source,clojure]
----
(afterglow.effects.params/build-aim-param)
----

By itself this call would simply return a non-dynamic point telling
fixtures to aim directly at a height of zero, centered on the X axis,
two meters towards the audience. However, you will use one or more of
the following optional keyword parameters to get the dynamic target
point you want:

[cols=",,",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Parameter |Default |Purpose
|`:x` |`0` |How many meters along the X axis the target point is found

|`:y` |`0` |How high up or down the Y axis is the target point

|`:z` |`2` |How far towards or away from the audience is the target
point

|`:frame-dynamic` |`true` |Whether the parameter should be calculated at
every frame, or just once
|=======================================================================

Collectively, `x`, `y`, and `z` specify a three-dimensional point
within the light show’s <<show_space#show-space,frame of reference>> telling the
lights where to aim. When this vector is supplied to an
<<effects#aim-effects,Aim Effect>>, it causes the attached lights to
make the specified movement, if they are capable.

If you need to convert inches or feet to meters, which are the
standard distance units in Afterglow, you can use
http://deepsymmetry.org/afterglow/doc/afterglow.transform.html#var-inches[afterglow.transform/inches]
and
http://deepsymmetry.org/afterglow/doc/afterglow.transform.html#var-feet[afterglow.transform/feet].

All of these parameters, except for `frame-dynamic`, can themselves be
dynamic parameters, such as show <<variable-parameters,variables>>
(with the convenience shorthand of just passing in the keyword by which
the show variable was stored) or <<oscillated-parameters,oscillated
parameters>>.

=== Pan Tilt Parameters

A more traditional way of aiming fixtures (in contrast to
<<parameters#direction-parameters,Direction Parameters>>) involves
setting pan and tilt angles. Afterglow supports this approach as well,
although even in this case you use angles expressed in the standard
show <<show_space#show-space,frame of reference>> regardless of how
the individual fixtures are hung. Pan Tilt parameters are an alternate
way to work with <<effects#direction-effects,Direction Effects>>. The
basic way to create one is to call:

[source,clojure]
----
(afterglow.effects.params/build-pan-tilt-param)
----

By itself this call would simply return a non-dynamic direction telling
fixtures to point directly at the audience. However, you will use one or
more of the following optional keyword parameters to get the dynamic
angles you want:

[cols=",,",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Parameter |Default |Purpose
|`:pan` |`0` |How many degrees counter-clockwise should the light turn
around the Y axis

|`:tilt` |`0` |How many degrees counter-clockwise should the light turn
around the X axis

|`:frame-dynamic` |`true` |Whether the parameter should be calculated at
every frame, or just once
|=======================================================================

The rotations requested by `pan` and `tilt` jointly identify the
direction the light should turn away from the audience. The result of
the parameter is a direction vector in the light show’s
<<show_space#show-space,frame of reference>> telling the lights which
direction they should point. When this vector is supplied to a
<<effects#direction-effects,Direction Effect>>, it causes the attached
lights to make the specified movement, if they are capable.

Note that although internally Afterglow works with angles expressed in
radians, the values of `pan` and `tilt` are in degrees, and are
converted to radians for the convenience of the user who is more
likely accustomed to working with angles expressed in degrees.

All of these parameters, except for `frame-dynamic`, can themselves be
dynamic parameters, such as show <<variable-parameters,variables>>
(with the convenience shorthand of just passing in the keyword by which
the show variable was stored) or <<oscillated-parameters,oscillated
parameters>>.

== Spatial Parameters

Spatial parameters allow you to base an effect parameter on the physical
arrangement or relationships between fixtures in your light show. The
way to create one is to call:

[source,clojure]
----
(afterglow.effects.params/build-spatial-param fixtures-or-heads f)
----

The required parameters are the fixtures and/or heads over which you
want this parameter to be calculated, and a function which, when invoked
with a fixture or head, returns a number or a dynamic `Number`
parameter.

If desired, the results returned for all included heads can be scaled
to fall within a standard range. Scaling is activated using the
optional keyword parameters `:max` and `:min`. If neither is supplied,
scaling is not performed. Passing a value for only `:max` activates
scaling with a default minimum value of `0`, and passing a value for
only `:min` activates scaling with a default maximum value of `255`.
The maximum value must be larger than the minimum value.

[cols=",,",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Parameter |Default |Purpose
|`:min` | n/a | If present, activates result scaling, and establishes
the smallest value this dynamic parameter will hold.
|`:max` | n/a | If present, activates result scaling, and establishes
the largest value this dynamic parameter will hold.
|`:frame-dynamic` |n/a | Whether the parameter should be calculated at
every frame, or just once.
|=======================================================================

As noted above, the values returned by `f` can themselves be
dynamic parameters, such as show <<variable-parameters,variables>>
(with the convenience shorthand of just passing in the keyword by which
the show variable was stored) or <<oscillated-parameters,oscillated
parameters>>. If `frame-dynamic` is not explicitly set, the spatial
parameter will be frame dynamic if any value returned by `f` is
frame-dynamic.

Useful things that `f` can do include calculating the distance of the
head from some point, either in 3D or along an axis, its angle from
some line, and so on. These can allow the creation of lighting
gradients across all or part of a show. Spatial parameters make
excellent building blocks for <<color-parameters,color>>,
<<direction-parameters,direction>> and <<aim-parameters,aim>>
parameters, as shown in the
<<effects#spatial-effects,effect examples>>.
