Fixture definitions tell afterglow what capabilities a given piece of
lighting hardware has, and how to control it to get the effects that are
being requested.

TODO: Write this page.

* Document how to write them, analyzing examples like the
http://deepsymmetry.org/afterglow/doc/afterglow.fixtures.blizzard.html[Blizzard]
definitions, with special attention on how to document default
orientations and head positions with respect to
<<show_space#show-space,show space>> so the geometry
works out.

* Explain how to create function specifications in all their variations,
with range helpers, etc., and list naming conventions established so
far, so that new fixtures can participate when they have similar
capabilities.
