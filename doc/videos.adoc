Report"></a>+++ Since I have been too busy working on the software to
get out and perform with it, I am deeply grateful to
https://github.com/dandaka[Vlad Rafeev] for getting this page started
by sharing a video of a
https://www.facebook.com/deepowerband/[Deepower audiovisual] show he

says, “My first experience with lights, still a lot to accomplish.”
And I say, there is a ton left to implement in the software too. But
it is already fun to see https://vimeo.com/153492480[great video like
