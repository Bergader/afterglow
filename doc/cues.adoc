Cues are designed to support creating user interfaces for controlling
effects. They provide a convenient way to organize, identify, trigger,
adjust, and monitor effects. Each
http://deepsymmetry.org/afterglow/doc/afterglow.show.html[show] in
Afterglow maintains a cue grid, which can be viewed and interacted
with through the
http://deepsymmetry.org/afterglow/doc/afterglow.core.html#var-start-web-server[embedded
web interface] and MIDI controller mapping implementations which can
be
http://deepsymmetry.org/afterglow/doc/afterglow.show.html#var-register-grid-controller[registered
as grid controllers], like the
http://deepsymmetry.org/afterglow/doc/afterglow.controllers.ableton-push.html[Ableton
Push].

The cue grid is a two dimensional arrangement of cues, where the
bottom left corner is assigned coordinates `(0, 0)`. X coordinates
increase from left to right, and Y coordinates increase from bottom to
top. The web interface and registered grid controllers display 64 cues
at a time in an 8&times;8 grid, and can be scrolled around that grid.
The user can set the web interface to track the scroll position of a
registered grid controller. When that is done, scrolling either
interface will cause the other to scroll in the same way, so the
browser window can act as documentation to help the user learn what
the cue name associated with each available cue pad on the controller.

You can also trigger cues from simpler MIDI controllers which don't
register as grid controllers by explicitly mapping notes or control
changes to cues using
http://deepsymmetry.org/afterglow/doc/afterglow.show.html#var-add-midi-control-to-cue-mapping[afterglow.show/add-midi-control-to-cue-mapping].
Regardless of the mechanism by which a cue is triggered, the web
interface, a registered grid controller, or an explicitly mapped MIDI
note or control change, feedback will be sent to all interfaces so the
status of the cue will be represented consistently on all of them.

Creating Cues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The
http://deepsymmetry.org/afterglow/doc/afterglow.effects.cues.html[afterglow.effects.cues]
namespace provides functions for creating cues.

TODO: Describe the functions and arguments, link to effect examples.

[[controlling-cues]]
Controlling Cues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The
http://deepsymmetry.org/afterglow/doc/afterglow.controllers.html[afterglow.controllers]
namespace defines some helpful functions for working with cues, and
defines a
http://deepsymmetry.org/afterglow/doc/afterglow.controllers.html#var-IGridController[grid
controller protocol] which rich controller mappings like the one for
the Ableton Push can use to attach themselves to a running show, and
synchronize with the web interface.

TODO: Flesh out, discuss individual functions.
