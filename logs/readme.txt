This directory is where development-mode log files are written, to
make it easy to debug problems which happen on background threads. The
log files themselves are ignored by git, so when you first check out
Afterglow, this directory will be empty (except for this explanation).
As you run it in your repl, you will start to collect logs here, and
they will hopefully help you figure out why things aren't working, if
you run into snags in learning how to use and extend the system.
