  "[Torrent F3](http://www.blizzardlighting.com/index.php?option=com_k2&view=item&id=174:torrent-f3â„¢&Itemid=71)
  moving head effects spotlight. The default patching orientation is sitting on its feet
  with the LCD and control panel right side up and facing the
  audience. In this orientation, at a pan of 0, the beam is straight
  into the audience.

  The origin of the light is, as for all moving heads, at the
  intersection of the pan and tilt axes. That is the point that you
  need to reference when patching the fixture and telling Afterglow
  where it has been hung within [show
  space](https://github.com/brunchboy/afterglow/blob/master/doc/show_space.adoc#show-space). The
  image below shows this default orientation, and the axes, for the
  fixture. If it is hung with this side of the base facing the
  audience, right side up, then you do not need to specify any
  rotations when you patch it. Otherwise, tell Afterglow how far it
  has been rotated around each of the axes when hanging:

  ![F3
  axes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brunchboy/afterglow/master/doc/assets/F3.png)

  The center pan value (aimed straight at the audience when hung in
  the default orientation described above), is defined as 85.5, half a
  revolution around from that, so that it has room to move in both
  directions from its resting point. It takes a change of -85.5 in the
  pan channel to rotate a half circle counterclockwise around the Y
  axis.

  At the center pan setting of 85.5, the center tilt value is 25,
  aiming the head straight out at the audience. At this position, it
  takes a change of -203 in the tilt channel to rotate a half circle
  counterclockwise around the X axis. (In other words, it can only
  tilt a little counterclockwise from here, but can flip right over in
  the clockwise direction.)

  If you are wondering why you are getting no light from a torrent,
  note that you need to explicitly set the shutter to open before the
  dimmer has any effect. Try something like:

```clojure
(show/add-effect! :torrent-shutter
  (afterglow.effects.channel/function-effect
    \"Torrents Open\" :shutter-open 50
    (show/fixtures-named \"torrent\")))

  8-fixture LED bar. Even though this fixture does not move, it is
  important to patch it at the correct orientation, so Afterglow can
  properly reason about the spatial relationships between the eight
  individual heads.

  The fixture origin is right between the fourth and fifth head, at
  the level of the lenses. The default orientation is with the bar
  parallel to the X axis, and the LED display and sockets all facing
  away from the audience.

  This fixture can be configured to use either 7 or 26 DMX channels.
  If you do not specify a mode when patching it, `:26-channel` is
  assumed; you can pass a value of `:7-channel` for `mode` if you are
  using it that way."
