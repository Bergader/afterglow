# Afterglow

A Clojure take on a DMX lighting control system leveraging the [Overtone](https://github.com/overtone/overtone) toolkit and the [Open Lighting Architecture](https://www.openlighting.org/ola/). For efficiency, Afterglow uses [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/overview) to communicate with the `olad` process running on the local machine via its [RPC Service](https://docs.openlighting.org/doc/latest/rpc_system.html).

## Installation

1. [Install OLA](https://www.openlighting.org/ola/getting-started/downloads/); I recommend using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) which lets you simply `brew install ola`. Once you launch the `olad` server you can interact with its embedded [web server](http://localhost:9090/ola.html), which is very helpful in seeing whether anything is working; you can even watch live DMX values changing.
2.  Download Afterglow from http://example.com/FIXME.

## Usage

FIXME: explanation

    $ java -jar afterglow-0.1.0-standalone.jar [args]

### Ideas

* Consider implementing asynchronous TCP communication via [aleph](https://github.com/ztellman/aleph). Or [Netty?](http://martintrojer.github.io/clojure/2013/07/07/coreasync-and-blocking-io/) which seems to have Protobuf support of some sort built in.

### References

* Clojure implementation of Protocol Buffers via [lein-protobuf](https://github.com/flatland/lein-protobuf) and [clojure-protobuf](https://github.com/flatland/clojure-protobuf).
* The incomplete [Java OLA client](https://github.com/OpenLightingProject/ola/tree/master/java).

### Related Work

* Am fixing the [broken Max external](https://wiki.openlighting.org/index.php/OlaOutput_Max_External). It fails because it tries to load an outdated version of the `libproto` DLL in a hardcoded bad library path. I have now been able to check out the source into `old/svn/olaoutput-read-only` and succeeded at building and fixing it. I separately downloaded the [Max 6.1.4 SDK](https://cycling74.com/downloads/sdk/). The maxhelp file has some seeming errors in it: a "state" message which seems unimplemented, and a second inlet which appears to really just be an argument. I have offered to share my changes and explore fixing the help unless the authors want to, on the open lighting Google group. They have, at my prompting, migrated to github, and I am committing my changes to a fork, in `git/olaoutput`.
